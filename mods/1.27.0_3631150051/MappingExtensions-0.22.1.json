  "description": "This adds a host of new things you can do with your maps as a mapper, and allows you to play said maps as a player. An update of the port of the PC original mod by Kyle 1413. Previously maintained by zoller27osu.\n\nReminder: difficulties that require both Mapping Extensions and Noodle Extensions at the same time do not work. This is intended behaviour on Noodle's part.",
